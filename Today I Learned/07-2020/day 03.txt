It's been a while. I started my studies with compiled/interpreted languages. 
The overview of compiled languages isn't new for me, I still remember some things from
the Electronic Engineering undergrad I didn't finish.
I've worked designing basic ALUs and simulating them,
with some CISC assembly (I think it was on a 8051 processor...)
And with C. I don't know how a compiler is written.

Now, the concept of interpreted langues is new for me.
It's quite interesting to know that's how Python works.

What really stood out, though, was the byte compiling, or 
JIT compiling. That's intriguing! Certainly what I'll do next.

For now, I'll do some basic arithmetics coding, 
then a few operation with strings, just to get things started.

That's it for today!
