Installed a VM, Ubuntu 16.04 (I don't want problems with my OS,
I need a stable version), Python 3.7.2, only to then discover
it was installed by default. LOL. Intalled Zsh terminal, 
and then Oh My Zsh, and what can I say? I like pretty things.
Also, user experience, right?
Installed Sublime Text 3, too.

Now I'm starting to remember how to use the terminal!
And damn, some things are annoying. 
I can't set up the ssh authentication on github for shit.
I've followed the steps on the tutorial a few times,
but no luck. Well, a problem for tomorrow.
