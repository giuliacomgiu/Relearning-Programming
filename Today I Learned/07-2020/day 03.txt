Installed a VM, Ubuntu 16.04 (I don't want problems with my OS,
I need a stable version), Python 3.7.2, only to then discover
it was installed by default. LOL. Intalled Zsh terminal, 
and then Oh My Zsh, and what can I say? I like pretty things.
Also, user experience, right?
Installed Sublime Text 3, too.

Now I'm starting to remember how to use the terminal!
And damn, some things are annoying. 
I can't set up the ssh authentication on github for shit.
I've followed the steps on the tutorial a few times,
but no luck. Well, a problem for tomorrow.

A good reminder:

Best Practices for Identifier Naming.

    Better have class names starting with a capital letter. All other identifiers should begin with a lowercase letter.
    Declare private identifiers by using the (‘_’) underscore as their first letter.
    Don’t use ‘_’ as the leading and trailing character in an identifier. As Python built-in types already use this notation.
    Avoid using names with only one character. Instead, make meaningful names.
        For example – While i = 1 is valid, but writing iter = 1 or index = 1 would make more sense.
    You can use underscore to combine multiple words to form a sensible name.
        For example – count_no_of_letters.
