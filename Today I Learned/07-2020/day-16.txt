Finished the last assignment  from
Michiga University's Fourth module.
(relearning-programming/michigan-uni/module-4/assign-16-2/)
We didn't write the code ourselves,
but the goal was to read location data 
from a list (where.data), insert a new item
and display all of them on a map
through Google Maps API.

The first script (geoloads.py)
reads the locations on where.data
retrieves the geocoded response and
stores it in a database (geodata.sqlite).

Then, geodump.py reads the database mentioned
above and creates a JSON (where.js) file.

Last, but not least, an html file
creates a view of the map with where.js!
