Something great happened!
My uni has partnered with coursera and they will pay
for the certificates in the next three weeks! Ueba!
Which means I'll postpone the dictionary a little
to finish as much as possible.
Currently doing a python course from the University 
of Michigan!! Yay! Super excited! It's five modules 
and I've finished the first one already... 6 weeks in
a few hours lol
Now, on the second module, I'm actually closer to what
I'm learning. Only one problem: It's python 2 still.
Anyway, today onwards I'll post the assignments they 
suggest here.
