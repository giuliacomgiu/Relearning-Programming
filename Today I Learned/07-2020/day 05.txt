Today I took a closer look at lists and tuples.
<files lists.py and tuples.py>
I was following an online course, but turns out
the python documentation is phenomenal! 
Why didn't I start out with it, I hear you cry.
Well. Not sure. Found the previous guide on python's 
webpage.

Some of the things I did today:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq

I focused on what seemed trickier.
