Did some exercises on python strings, lists and tuples.
Now, lists give me chills... so many un-typecasted objects
on a lists, and lists nested on lists...
Fun thing to learn that lists' methods modify the original list.
You don't have to do:
list = list.insert()

Tuples are immutable and lists are mutable,
because tuples are a fixed size, and lists
are dynamic. Dynamic memory allocation in C
was a bit of a pain... Now, when I finish studying 
JITs, I'll maybe check this out!

But then again, this is very specific to python, 
maybe I should learn something more generic.

That's it for today!!
