Today I started the fourth Michigan Uni 
Python For Everyone module. It's Data Structures
for Python. I installed SQLite, created a database
inserted some data, updated it through the SQLite
browser, and later on did all of the above
on a python script <3

After this is done. I'll study the theory
more: relations, tuples and attributes.
