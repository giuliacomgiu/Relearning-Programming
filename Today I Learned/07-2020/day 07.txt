My, my... Again, a day late.
Found a database with portuguese word
(https://www.corpusdata.org/formats.asp)
And wrote a code to open it, remove unnecessary
data, and save the result in a new file.
See "dicio-de-rimas.py".
Also watched some videos from 
youtube.com/user/SocraticaStudios
Absolutely fantastic.
