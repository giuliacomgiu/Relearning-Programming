Yesterday I learned some basic SQL commands,
CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, DROP, UPDATE.
Today I learned more about data models and
relational SQL: inserting relational data,
reconstructing data with the join command.
Now working on assign-15-7.py:
Reads xml data from iTunes website and
builds a database with them.
