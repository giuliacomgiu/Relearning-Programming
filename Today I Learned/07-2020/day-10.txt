I'm a little late on the reports,
this is a the-day-before-yesterday I learned.
I actually finished the first two modules of
Michigan Uni's Python For Everyone courses.
They expected you to take 7 weeks to finish 
each one of them. They're very introductory,
but now that I'm learning new stuff, I find the
lessons to be very valuable. It's introducing me
to new resources, such as regex, which I LOVED
(quite a usefull thing, isn't it?) and BeautifulSoup.
I've made my first code that searches the browser!
Yay!! I'm stocked. Anyway, uploading all recent
assignments to relearning-programming/michigan-uni
