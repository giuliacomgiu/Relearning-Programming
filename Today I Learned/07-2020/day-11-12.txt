I finished the third Michigan Uni course!
I learned some XML and JSON, which I used
to extract data from a google API.
For mor info, se assignment 13 on 
relearning-programing/michigan-uni/module-3
Tomorrow I'll start module 4 because I have
a time limit. When I can no longer get certificates
from coursera, I'll come back and revisit what
I find necessary for a more in-depth study.
