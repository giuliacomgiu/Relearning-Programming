Ah, so I learned some Basic Authentication 
in HTTP and the basic usage of cookies 
on Express generated server.

A few days ago I learned about base64
encoding on ROOT Girls (a series of seminars
on Security of Information by UFC - Universidade
Federal do Ceara), and it was nice to see it in
action.
