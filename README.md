# Relearning-Programming

Guess who's back... So, I've decided to relearn programming, from the basics to a professional level, though I haven't decided on which area I'll specialize in. Here's how it's going to work: I'll create a folder called Today I learned, and update it as frequently as possible until I start working on bigger projects. The updates will be short and straight to the point. Everything will be organized by date. As the project evolves, I'll include a Table of Contents here, so it'll be easier to see what I've done. Let's get going!
